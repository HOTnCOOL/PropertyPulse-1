Implement three distinct user pathways in the property booking application:
1. Administrator Pathway (Current Implementation):
- Maintain existing functionality with full CRUD capabilities
- Access to all administrative features and dashboards
- Complete control over properties, bookings, and guest management
2. Public Pathway (Anonymous Users):
Requirements:
- Target users: Anonymous visitors and non-authenticated users
- No registration/authentication required
- Entry point: Properties page as landing page
- Remove all administrative functions (create/edit/delete)
- Display only essential property information
- Show availability calendar (booked/free dates only, no booking details)
- Add "Book Now" button on each property
Flow:
1. Properties page → View property details
2. Book Now → Guest Registration (pre-filled property)
3. Guest Registration → Payment page
4. Payment completion → Guest Dashboard (with booking reference)
3. Registered Guest Pathway:
Requirements:
- Access method: Email + Booking reference
- Personal dashboard displaying:
  * Booking details and reference number
  * Payment information (past/due/upcoming)
  * Check-in/out instructions
  * Door access codes
  * Location and directions
  * Property-specific guest information
Technical Specifications:
1. Availability Calendar:
- Visual display of booked dates
- No sensitive booking details shown
- Simple free/occupied status
2. Payment Implementation:
- Mock payment system
- Payment options: cash, bank, credit card, Stripe
- Allow partial (deposit) or full payment
- Generate booking reference after successful payment
3. Navigation Flow:
- Book Now button redirects to Guest Registration
- Pre-filled property selection
- Successful payment redirects to Guest Dashboard
- Guest Dashboard accessible via booking reference + email
Database Schema:
- Utilize existing tables: properties, guests, bookings, payments
- Maintain current relations and data structure
- Add necessary fields for guest access and booking references
Security Considerations:
- Restrict administrative functions
- Protect sensitive booking information
- Secure access to guest dashboard
