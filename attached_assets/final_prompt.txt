# Property Booking Payment System Enhancement

## Core Requirements

1. Payment Deadlines
- All package payments must be completed by 12:00 (noon) on activation day
- Full payment and matching deposit required for activation

2. Prepayment Discount System
- 10% incremental discount for each prepaid period
- Maximum discount cap of 50%
- Sequential payment required (no skipping periods)
- All prior periods must be paid before prepaying future periods

3. Package Duration Rules
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly packages available
- Longer packages can be split into shorter ones
- Deposit equals package amount with flexible reduction options

## Implementation Tasks

1. Backend Updates
- Extend payment schema to track prepayment status
- Add discount calculation logic in price estimation
- Implement sequential payment validation
- Handle package conversion logic

2. Frontend Updates
- Update PaymentEstimator to show prepayment discounts
- Enhance PaymentRegistration to handle early payments
- Add validation for sequential payments
- Display package conversion options

3. Database Schema Extensions
- Add prepayment tracking fields
- Store discount history
- Track package conversions

## Example Scenarios

1. Standard Payment:
   Daily package at $100/day, paid on activation = $100 (no discount)

2. Prepayment Example:
   10-day package prepayment calculation:
   - Day 1: $100 (0% off)
   - Day 2: $90 (10% off)
   - Day 3: $80 (20% off)
   - Day 4: $70 (30% off)
   - Day 5: $60 (40% off)
   - Days 6-10: $50 each (50% off)
   Total: $600 instead of $1000

3. Package Conversion:
   Monthly package can be converted to weekly/daily packages while maintaining value

## Technical Considerations

1. Data Validation
- Ensure all prior periods are paid
- Validate payment sequences
- Track discount applications

2. User Experience
- Clear display of available discounts
- Transparent payment history
- Easy package conversion interface

3. Business Rules
